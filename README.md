# vis_classic
This is a modified release of the Classic Spectrum Analyzer (vis_classic) Winamp visualisation plug-in by Mike Lynch & done so with his kind permission. The changes are minor though may contain some bug fixes &amp; are primarily aimed at improving the Winamp plug-in integration with the requirements of being a bundled WACUP plug-in. The un-modified copy of the source is also provided.

It is provided as-is with all changes applied over the top of the existing source code (note: some files have been changed &/or removed compared to the original source code release). The Winamp 5.55 SDK as well as some of the newer Winamp 5.666 header files from <a target="_blank" href="https://getwacup.com/sdk/">here</a> are required to build this release.
